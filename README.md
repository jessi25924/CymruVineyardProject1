### Code

* Markdown Cheatsheet provided by Adam Pritchard, Code Institute.

* The majority of the codebase for this website is built using [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/). Bootstrap's prebuilt components and responsive grid system were utilised to create a modern and user-friendly design with minimal custom coding.

* Footer placement: The idea for keeping the footer fixed at the bottom of the page, regardless of contetnt length, was inspired by a Code Institute lesson. The solution was implemented using Bootstrap's utility classes.

* Navbar positioning: Similarly, the technique to align the navigation bar at the top right of the page was inspired by Code Institute. This adjustment also leveraged Bootstrap's features.

* Fixed Navbar: The concept of keeping the navbar fixed at the top of the page, ensuring it stays visible while scrolling, was also inspired by a Code Institute lesson. This functionality was implemented using Bootstrap's fixed-top class together with custom CSS adjustments for styling.

By combining Bootstrap's built-in functionality with insights from Code Institute lessons, the site achieves a seamless blend of professional design and tailored adjustments.
