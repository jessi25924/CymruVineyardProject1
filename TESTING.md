## Lighthouse Testing


## Responsiveness

I tested the layout's adaptability to various screen sizes and orientation, ensuring that the users enjoy a consistent and optimised experience, whether they're browsing on mobile, tablet or laltop/desktop. This ensure that all elements, such as images, text and navigation, adapt correctly and maintain usability regardless of the device.
